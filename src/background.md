I recently had a few questions about what led me to building a type checker, so I thought it would be a good idea to put together an overview about things I have built, and the ideas carried along the way.

I got into programming for a few reasons: building ideas and solving logical problems in neat ways is (mostly) fun. Through the process, I have built up an interest in language design and the shortest and fastest ways to put things together.

Throughout my teenage years I played around with random things like C#, video editing, 3D modelling and animation. Around 2018 I started planning out projects more and *contributing* every month. I got a Raspberry Pi, did some [GUI thing with WPF](https://github.com/kaleidawave/Polar) and played around with mathematics in Python. Towards the end of the year, I built a Medium like site while experimenting with frameworks like React and services like Firebase. In 2019, I learned more about JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL and Golang. In doing so, learned a few more fundamentals, like [programming with types](https://github.com/kaleidawave/randomizer), and communicating over the network.

In 2020, having getting tired of writing a lot of manual DOM operations in JS, I wanted to build abstractions to better write and reuse logic. Rather than going back to using an existing framework, I decided I would write my own framework to get my head around how reactive frameworks work. Around the same type I got into parsing, it started with regular expressions, then onto lexing and recursive descent parsing. During the downtime from the first Coronavirus lockdown, I built a framework/compiler called Prism. I improved my parsing skills up by building a slightly incorrect but working [JS, CSS and HTML parser](https://github.com/kaleidawave/prism/tree/main/src/chef). From the parser ASTs, I built up information about the [templates](https://github.com/kaleidawave/prism/blob/main/src/templating/template.ts) that were used to generate optimized output. I did some experiments involving [hydration and SSR](/posts/jit-hydration/). [I learnt a bit of rust and got the framework to output views that could be run in Rust](/posts/hackernews-clone-prism-rust/).

In 2021, I took my previous experience with parsers in JS and started learning [Rust to write a more advanced parser](https://twitter.com/kaleidawave/status/1351235585495740416), experimented with [Rust multithreading](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/blob/75d31ddb60eee495915fcf805a56221d2e79ce7d/parser/src/lib.rs#L220-L233) and adding positions where the AST parsed from. After some quick success, [I started exploring adding type checking](https://twitter.com/kaleidawave/status/1351235585495740416). I put out a [final post and update to the Prism compiler](/posts/prism-one-point-five) and then worked at [divriots](https://divriots.com/) over the summer building some cool products for the web! (definitely check them out!). After that, took a bit of a break from everything as I had to college again.

In early spring of 2022, I had some thoughts of type level things to do in a compiler. So I then spent my summer break trying to get it all working in the constraints of Rust. I added typed effects, always dependent parameters, an LSP and rewrote a lot of last year's parser and checker code (generics and the representation of types and contexts were overhauled). At the same time, I wrote some [posts about Rust and building web things with it](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/tags/all) for [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/). In managed to write a [post about the checker and put it out](/posts/introducing-ezno). During the Autumn, back at college, I found some time to [add more features, including a REPL and a binary format for the contexts](/posts/ezno-23/).

In 2023, [I open sourced the parser](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/discussions/2). Now, hopefully the checker will be open sourced and released this summer!
