Hey ðŸ‘‹ I am Ben and am currently 23! I am interested in language design, type theory and the compilers. I built this site to showcase and explain some of my projects!

You can support the writing of these posts and other projects:

[This site supports RSS](https://kaleidawave.github.io/feed.xml). You can read a bit on [why I write and work on projects](/background) and also read [how this site is built](/architecture). If you find any errors on this site, you can let me know on [Twidder](https://twitter.com/kaleidawave) or via the email `kaleidawave` at the Google mails.

I made the name `kaleidawave` years ago when I was 16. It is a combination of *'kaleida'* a kaleidoscope effect in After Effects and *'wave'* (from wave world, another After Effects effect). I would like to change it but there are no usernames any more and it will probably break a bunch of links across the internet. Don't take it too seriously ðŸ˜œ
