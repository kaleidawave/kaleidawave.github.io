I made the name `kaleidawave` years ago when I was 16. It is a combination of *'kaleida'* a kaleidoscope effect in After Effects and *'wave'* (from *wave world*, another After Effects effect). I would like to change it but there are no usernames any more and it will probably break a bunch of links across the internet. Don't take it too seriously ðŸ˜œ
